## Project-4-Machine-Learning
Concept of a restaurant informational dashboard using machine learning to provide predictions/forecasts from POS data and other sources (pytrends, etc)# Historical Analysis 

## Project Proposal - Machine Learning for forecasting and prediction - Restaurant Analysis

Please find the project proposal inside the folder marked Documents

### Project Title - Restaurant Dashboard - a litte bit of machine learning and a sprinkle of visual analysis

### Purpose of project 

Economic slow down means every business needs to stay intelligent about their decision making.
Small restaurants are at risk â€“ Less general spending by consumers as well as increasing rent costs due to interest rate hikes are causing stress on owner. 
By using data and machine learning, can we optimizing aspect of a running business?

## Sources of Data

-   POS data obtained from local family restaurant

-	https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=chicken&months=240&currency=aud#dropdown-lvl107
-	https://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=lamb&months=240&currency=aud

## Application

### NOTE

In order to run the app, once locally stored, please DELETE the RestaurantDB.sqlite before running app.py

This will allow for a clean run through demonstration of the analysis - If this file is not removed BEFORE running app.py at any stage - the DB will double up its records every time app.py is executed and the DB is not removed beforehand. 

Future implementations will have a db checker that will skip running the LOAD portion of the scripts to avoid record double ups being written to the database.


The implementation of the dashboard was constructed purely for demonstration purposes and much more front end development needs to be undertaken for the final product.


## Data Exploration and Transformation

Please refer to the Juypter notebook files located in the folder marked Resources for a step by step walk through of all exploration and transformation information.
